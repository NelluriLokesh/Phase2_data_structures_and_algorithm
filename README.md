## Introduction

DSPlayground is designed to provide clear and functional implementations of various data structures. It allows you to explore, modify, and understand how these fundamental components of computer science work.

## Features

- Implementations of fundamental data structures.
- Easy to read and modify code.
- Examples and usage demonstrations.
- Suitable for learning and teaching purposes.

## Installation

To get started with DSPlayground, clone this repository to your local machine using:

# bash
git clone https://github.com/NelluriLokesh/Phase2_data_structures_and_algorithm

## Navigate into the project directory:
cd DSPlayground


## Usage
You can explore and run the implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is contained within its own file or directory.

## Data Structures
# Lists
Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures. In this project, you will find implementations of:

## Basic list operations (adding, removing, accessing elements).
# Stacks
Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The implementation includes:

# Push and pop operations.
Peek operation to view the top element.
# Queues
Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The implementation includes:

# Enqueue and dequeue operations.
Peek operation to view the front element.
# Single Linked Lists
Single Linked Lists are a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. The implementation includes:

# Insertion and deletion of nodes.
Traversal of the list.
Double Linked Lists
Double Linked Lists are similar to single linked lists but allow traversal in both directions. The implementation includes:

# Insertion and deletion of nodes.
Traversal of the list in both directions.
Special operations for stacks and queues using double linked lists.
